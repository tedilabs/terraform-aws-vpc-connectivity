If youâ€™re using Route 53 as your DNS service, you can configure a CNAME record within the hosted zone that you own. `custom_domain` as defined below.
    (Required) `name` - The name of the custom domain. The custom domain name will be used in addition to the domain name that VPC Lattice generates for the service.

  (Optional) The configuration to add one or more listeners for the service. Set up listeners and rules to define how network traffic is routed within the service. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. Each listener has a default action, and you can optionally define rules to enable content-based routing to the target groups that make up your service. Each block of `listeners` as defined below.
    (Required) `name` - The name of the service listener. The name must be unique within the service. The valid characters are a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (-). You can't use a hyphen as the first or last character, or immediately after another hyphen.

If `port` is not specified and `protocol` is `HTTP`, the value will default to `80`. If `port` is not specified and `protocol` is `HTTPS`, the value will default to `443`.

        (Optional) `weight` - The weight to use routing traffic to `target_group`. how requests are distributed to the target group. Only required if you specify multiple target groups for a forward action. For example, if you specify two target groups, one with a weight of 10 and the other with a weight of 20, the target group with a weight of 20 receives twice as many requests as the other target group. Valid value is `0` to `999`. Defaults to `100`.
    (Optional) `rules` - A list of rules to enable content-based routing to the target groups that make up the service. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. Each block of `rules` block as defined below.
